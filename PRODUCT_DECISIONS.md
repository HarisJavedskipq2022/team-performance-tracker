# Team Performance Tracker - Product Decisions & Architecture

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document outlines the key product decisions, architectural choices, and trade-offs made during the development of the Team Performance Tracker MVP. The system is designed to help HR managers track goals, skills, feedback, and reviews for their teams.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component design
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) for simplicity
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons + custom components
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

**Rationale**: Next.js provides excellent developer experience with built-in routing, API routes, and SSR capabilities. React 19 offers the latest performance improvements. Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with consistent design.

### Backend Architecture
- **API**: Next.js API Routes (serverless functions)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Prepared for NextAuth.js (not implemented in MVP)
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready with docker-compose for local development

**Rationale**: Next.js API routes eliminate the need for a separate backend server, reducing complexity. PostgreSQL provides robust relational data handling. Prisma offers type-safe database operations and excellent developer experience.

### Database Design
- **Users**: Core user management with roles (Employee, Manager, HR Manager, Admin)
- **Goals**: Comprehensive goal tracking with status, priority, and due dates
- **Skills**: Skill management with user proficiency levels
- **Feedback**: Peer-to-peer feedback system
- **Reviews**: Performance review tracking

**Rationale**: Normalized database design ensures data integrity while maintaining query performance. The schema supports future expansion for complex performance tracking scenarios.

## üéØ MVP Feature Selection

### Core Feature: Goals Management
**Why Goals First?**
1. **High Impact**: Goal tracking directly affects team productivity
2. **Clear Value Proposition**: Immediate benefit for managers and employees
3. **Foundation**: Goals serve as the basis for reviews and feedback
4. **Measurable**: Easy to demonstrate ROI and success metrics

### Implemented Features
- ‚úÖ **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete goals
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Filtering**: Status, priority, user, and text search
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: Instant status changes and progress tracking
- ‚úÖ **User Assignment**: Assign goals to specific team members
- ‚úÖ **Due Date Management**: Track deadlines and overdue goals
- ‚úÖ **Priority System**: Critical, High, Medium, Low prioritization

### Deferred Features (Future Sprints)
- üîÑ **Feedback System**: Peer feedback and 360 reviews
- üîÑ **Skills Assessment**: Detailed skill tracking and development plans
- üîÑ **Analytics Dashboard**: Performance metrics and reporting
- üîÑ **Notifications**: Email/in-app notifications for deadlines
- üîÑ **Team Collaboration**: Comments and goal collaboration features

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Trade-offs Considered

### 1. Monolith vs Microservices
**Decision**: Monolithic Next.js application
**Trade-off**: 
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Faster development, simpler deployment, easier debugging
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Potential scaling limitations, tighter coupling
**Rationale**: For MVP and small-to-medium teams, monolith provides faster time-to-market

### 2. Client-Side vs Server-Side Rendering
**Decision**: Hybrid approach with client-side for interactivity
**Trade-off**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Better user experience, real-time updates
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Larger bundle size, SEO considerations
**Rationale**: Goals management requires high interactivity; SEO is not critical for internal tools

### 3. Real-time vs Polling Updates
**Decision**: Manual refresh with optimistic updates
**Trade-off**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Simpler implementation, lower server load
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Not truly real-time, potential data inconsistency
**Rationale**: For MVP, manual refresh is sufficient; WebSocket implementation can be added later

### 4. Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Deferred authentication to focus on core features
**Trade-off**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Faster MVP development, focus on core value
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Not production-ready without auth
**Rationale**: Authentication is table stakes but doesn't differentiate the product

### 5. Database Choice
**Decision**: PostgreSQL over NoSQL
**Trade-off**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: ACID compliance, complex queries, mature ecosystem
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Potentially over-engineered for simple use cases
**Rationale**: HR data requires consistency and complex relationships

## üë• Team Leadership Strategy (2 Sprints)

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Goals (Week 1-2)
**Team Structure**: 3 developers + 1 designer + 1 PM

**Sprint Goals**:
- Set up development environment and CI/CD
- Implement basic authentication and user management
- Build Goals CRUD functionality
- Create responsive UI framework

**Leadership Approach**:
- **Daily Standups**: Focus on blockers and dependencies
- **Pair Programming**: For complex database design and API architecture
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory for all PRs, focus on consistency
- **Sprint Demo**: Show working Goals feature to stakeholders

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Technical Debt**: Allocate 20% time for refactoring
- **Scope Creep**: Strict feature freeze after day 3
- **Dependencies**: Identify external dependencies early

### Sprint 2: Enhancement & Polish (Week 3-4)
**Sprint Goals**:
- Add filtering, search, and advanced goal management
- Implement basic feedback system
- Create analytics dashboard
- Performance optimization and testing

**Leadership Approach**:
- **Feature Ownership**: Each developer owns a specific feature area
- **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Designer embedded with development team
- **User Testing**: Conduct usability testing with 3-5 HR managers
- **Documentation**: Technical and user documentation

**Quality Assurance**:
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for API, E2E tests for critical paths
- **Performance Monitoring**: Set up basic monitoring and alerting
- **Security Review**: Basic security audit before demo

### Team Communication Strategy
1. **Slack Channels**: #team-performance-dev, #team-performance-design
2. **Weekly All-Hands**: Progress updates and roadmap alignment
3. **Retrospectives**: End of each sprint, focus on process improvement
4. **Stakeholder Updates**: Bi-weekly demos with HR leadership

### Success Metrics
- **Technical**: 95% uptime, <2s page load times, 0 critical bugs
- **Product**: 80% user adoption within first month, positive feedback scores
- **Team**: Sprint velocity improvement, low technical debt accumulation
